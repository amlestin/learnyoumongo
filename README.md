# learnyoumongo

My solutions to nodeschool's learnyoumongo, updated to MongoDB ^3.0.0

The hints for all the challenges are outdated. Most of the recommended methods
of mongo are deprecated! I toke the job to read the docs to found the
updated methods that can resolve all the problems.

Any suggestions or questions are welcome!
